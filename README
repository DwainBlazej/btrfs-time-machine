A script to mimic time machine on Mac OS X by using BTRFS snapshots in combination with rsync.

Script works by rsync'ing your data onto a btrfs filesystem, then taking btrfs snapshots of that rsync'ed directory.

WARNING: Version 0.2 or higher are not backwards compatible with version 0.1. I recommend running on a clean btrfs partition.
